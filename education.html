        <ul>
            <li class = 'collapsible'>11-485: Introduction to Deep Learning 🩷🌟</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 4/5</p>
                <p>Overall: The professor is amazing. She teaches content straight out of the textbook she wrote which means she knows
                    it super well, and classes are structured and paced perfectly. She's also super kind and interactive, making the lectures
                    really fun. If you really want to understand probability, this is definitely the class.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: Solutions are short but take a bit of creativity to come up with. Questions are exactly like homeworks so the only studying required is 
                    reviewing past problems. You get an index card of notes which was super helpful for me.
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks: Around 9 questions from the textbook, and each one has pretty short answers. However it was pretty difficult coming up with 
                    solutions or proofs. Every homework taught you something new and important for later in the course, which I quite liked.
                </p>
            </div>
            <li class = 'collapsible'>05-391: Designing Human-Centered Interfaces 🌟</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 3/5</p>
                <p>Overall: Every single problem in this class is a leetcode / interview problem. Because I had seen all of the problems before, the class was a lot 
                    easier for me. Implementing these problems in SML was a challenge though, and I'd say lectures were not the easiest or most 
                    entertaining to follow.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: Always a time crunch since you have to think of the solution first, and then scribble it out. My best exam was during recruiting season
                    when I was actively leetcoding, so perhaps that says a lot. 
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks: I really enjoyed the programming. You need to plan and think ahead before actually coding it out, which was the first CS class I had 
                    to do that for so far. The written assignments were time consuming and I didn't enjoy them as much as I didn't feel like I grew or learn much from them.

            <li class = 'collapsible'>21-370: Discrete Time Finance 🩷</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 2/5</p>
                <p>Overall: Great class with a lovely professor at the time (Prof Yeung) who is super funny and kind. Grading was super generous though the content was a bit difficult.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: These were completely open note and had questions similar to ones on midterm practice problems. The grading was also super generous.
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks: A bit difficult for me and I had to go to office hours for almost all of the problem sets. But since they only keep the grade of the three best problems, they were ultimately okay. I recommend doing all the problems regardless, since they're helpful for midterms and understanding the material.
                </p>

                <p>Difficulty: 1/5</p>
                <p>Overall: A very chill class and probably the easiest math class at CMU while maintaining necessity and rigor.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: There were three midterms that were all super easy and allowed a cheat sheet. However the final was more difficult for me.
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks: There were webworks which were primarily computational and problem sets which were primarily proof based. They took me around 2 hours total per week and were pretty straightforward. Some problem sets would have one very difficult question, in which case office hours are pretty helpful for getting the right direction and determining what you need to do for the problem.

            <p>Overall: Pretty heavy the whole semester. </p>
            <p>Thoughts: I was quite worried going into the semester since my workload would be pretty heavy, and I was TAing two courses on top of recruiting season. 
                However, I ended up achieving all my goals, which goes to show that you can take on as much as you challenge yourself to take. That being said, 
                it was indeed a lot and to make it through involved living a very unsustainable and unhealthy lifestyle, which I would not like to do again.
            </p>
            <p>Advice: Reach out to new people. Talk to those in your classes outside of your friend group. I met so many cool people this semester who 
                are really different from me in terms of personality, interests, and lifestyles.

        <h3> Spring 2025</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="collapsible">21-241: Linear Transformations and Matrices 🩷</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 4/5</p>
              <p>Overall: A lot of this class is just letting your brain
                marinate on the content you've injested, but it's very rewarding and you can definitely
                feel your brain grow as the class progresses. Content was super interesting and dealt with 
                many abstract topics. This was definitely the hardest class of my freshman year but the TAs
                and professors are super accommodating, helpful, and intelligent. 
              </p>
              <p>Exams: Very difficult for me. Some questions would have multiple versions 
                of different difficulties and point values; I would suggest thinking through the 
                lower point value ones first and sketch a solution before doing the full point questions
                unless you're very confident in your answer.
              </p>
              <p>Homeworks: Difficult but fun. You write up the solutions in a timed, proctored
                environment called a writing session, but the questions are posted ahead of time so 
                really you have a lot of time to think. You will surely become very close to the group you
                choose, and other people in the class, as you guys struggle together.

                <p>Difficulty: 2/5</p>
                <p>Overall: The content is pretty applicable for quant and built my recursive problem solving.
                    I wasn't super involved in this class, but still enjoyed the material taught.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: Easy! They released a bunch of practice problems and some would
                    be exactly the same as the actual short answer questions. Lots of true/false and 
                    fill in the blanks.  
                </p>
                <p>Homework: Were in SML and pretty light / short in terms of lines of code. 
                    I got docked more points for the written parts, but overall it was alright.

            <li class="collapsible">21-270: Introduction to Mathematical Finance 🌟</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 3/5</p>
                <p>Overall: I loved the professor's (Dr. David Handron) teaching. Definitely needed 
                    a lot of help from the TAs to get used to the content and understand the purpose
                    behind the strategies we learned. 
                </p>
                <p>Exams: he first midterm absolutely rocked my boat and I couldn't figure out any of the four 
                    questions (I also didn't study enough, so it's definitely on me). 
                    But once I got the hang of it, the midterms became alright/reasonable. 
                </p>
                <p>Homework: Grading is a lot lighter than CS classes, but since answers are all numerical,
                    you have to have the right answer to get a good grade. For me, OH was fundamental for 
                    completing homeworks.

            <p>Other commitments: TAed 15-151, danced in a campus kpop group, and attended a hackathon</p>
            <p>Overall: Deadly during first half, medium after 07-180 (mini) was over</p>
            <p>Thoughts: This semester was very hard mentally for me, but brought a lot of personal growth and resilience. 
                The first half of the semester was exceptionally difficult due to important people in my life leaving,
                but it led me to grew closer to my friends (especially those in 15-251 with me). Was also looking into 
                housing for next year which brought along its own stressors. My schedule was unmanageable without skipping classes
                and I was constantly grinding to finish homework. Midsemester grades were atrocious, but after the AI mini finished
                it was a lot more manageable and I somehow healed my grades and soul.
            </p>
            <p>Advice: Take some time to reflect. I wish I really thought through my major declaration,
                future housing, and relationships. Would definitely have suffered less this semester (and 
                future semesters) if I had taken the time to figure out what I really want and look at the bigger picture.

        <h3> Fall 2024</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="collapsible">21-127: Concepts in Mathematics 🩷</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 4/5</p>
                <p>I LOVED THIS CLASS. WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Professor (John Mackey) is genuinely the best
                    lecturer and an incredibly interesting person. The content (discrete math at other universities
                    plus some extra fun stuff) was also transformative
                    and formalized everything I knew about CS, problem solving, and technical communication. 
                    Also served as an introduction to LaTeX which I love almost as much as I loved this class.
                    Met some of my favorite people in this class, and also bonded with others later on over our
                    love for 15-151. Ended up TAing the semester after.
                </p>
                <p>Midterms are curved and were very fun for me. If you understand the content, they're light,
                    but if not, they serve as a good reminder to spend more time with the material.
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks were so fun. I loved LaTeXing it all up and creating beauty from mathematics.
                    There were also optional bonus problems that had some interesting tricks to them. 
                </p>
              </div>
            <li class="collapsible">15-112: Fundamental of Computer Science & Programming 🌟</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 2/5</p>
                <p> Basically your average data structures and algorithms class. The content carried
                    me through many OAs and technical interviews (who needs leetcode when you have 122)!
                </p>
                <p>Ran out of time, especially on the first midterm. But they are curved in the sense that 
                    questions many people get wrong are weighted less, so in the end my grades were a lot higher
                    than I expected. Questions were pretty reasonable and reflective of past homework assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Homeworks were pretty straightforward and in C. They do take some time / are quite long 
                    but are doable and reflective of the programming we do in labs. I spent more time helping 
                    non-CS friends with assignments than I spent doing them myself.

                <p> Difficulty: 4/5</p>
                <p> Overall: Took a placement exam in the beginning of the year and qualified for honors linear algebra
                    (matrix theory). Class was small so I was able to get a lot of one-on-one help from the 
                    professor and the TAs. This was the first class I really struggled in so I didn't have the
                    best experience, but it prepared me very well for future classes in that I learned how to ask for
                    help and prepare for difficult exams. 
                </p>
                <p> Exams: Each test had one proof problem that I could never fully get. The computational problems were alright
                    though and carried my grade. Was this professors first time teaching, though, so this might change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Homeworks: All I can say is that I did 90% of the homework in OH. Questions were difficult, 
                    the proofs for them even harder. The grading is lenient though.

                    It felt like this class made me miss out on a lot of fun get togethers with friends 
                    and the labs were questionable. Professor was extraordinarily kind.

                <p>
                    Lab Notebooks: These took way too much time and was all busy work. However, I think all the lab requirements are like this.
                    They graded really leniently except for the second notebook which was ultimately curved but made me question everything.

                It was very fun to meet people and I had the best time of my life.
                Many core memories were made and I think I will always look back lovingly on this time.
                A huge culture shift was that everyone was so interconnected despite there being so many people. 
            </p>
            <p>Advice: Join clubs, meet upperclassmen. It'll be a lot harder to join clubs and 
            meet people later on when workload increases. The few upperclassmen I did befriend
            were transformative to my college experience and gave tons of indispensable advice regarding 
            courses, professors, career, and people.
